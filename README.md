# 1871
a text based game about La Commune revolution in Paris 1871

1. plan.txt -> the narrative of the game
2. game_outline.txt -> an outline drawn from that narrative
3. key_concepts.txt -> started to sketch out possible classes and functions and arranged it in a simple tree outline
4. skeleton.py -> started to code out all the classes in their simplest form gradually adding functions and more meat

game_v1.py -> initially developed after plan.txt before I decided to try the above suggested process
sandbox.py -> a safe and friendly place where I write and test small bits of code
tavern_politics_alt.py -> an alternative solution and I don't know which is better (either a while-loop, or a function within a function)?

process_used.txt -> the workflow I decided to follow
questions.txt -> there's so many!
