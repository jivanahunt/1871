Start
introduction to the game -> setting the scene

The prussians have besieged Paris, you have three options: flee, fight, or bake with each option leading to a different scenario:
Need to have an error system if you don't write the correct answer

Scenario 1

	Cheeky dark narration of your glorious yet bleak life in the south of France:
	i.e. escaping to the South of France, have a good life, children etc -> working like horse
	the program exits with an exit last words 'well done you've survived!'
	
Scenario 2

	Narration about you going into a tavern and meeting activits and having a political conversation which leads to 5 outcomes:
	(Either you would input just one prompted keyword according to your political view, or the more complicated option would be
	to allow you to input your thoughts, and th have a bunch of keywords relating to a particular ideology.)
		
		1 marxist narration -> historical
		
		2 anarchist narration -> woman anarchist that lived in her 90s
		
		3 republican -> you suck and you're screwed narration
		
		4 feminist -> it didn't exist yet but it was a very interesting time narration
		
		5 random -> error handling / try again

Scenario 3

	Carry on baking -> narration of general life
	Boss gives again option to flee or to stay:
	
		Flee -> go back to France (Scenario 1)
		
		Stay -> Take over the bakery and run it like a cooperative
				Meet politicians who ask you to make a speech narration
					
					Speech 1 -> Anna Arendt
					
					Speech 2 -> bread and revolution
					
					Speech 3 -> revolution and bread
					
					Speech 4 -> other quote on bread
		
		
		Each scenario attaches you to a similar ideology than in the tavern			
					
Both scenarios 2 and 3 if carried on lead to:

Shoot out scene -> you get woken up in the middle of the night and have to fight the French
	According to your ideology you have different ammunition -> description and update on ammunition -> unfair
	Shoot out and bullet -> press enter to shoot and it has different random outcomes
	
Celebration scene
Narration - like every good frenchman you celebrate by eating
	going to eat with friends -> description of menu
	input -> you decide what you want to eat -> it takes out that price from your funds
		you get offered to eat again and whether you choose or not you get given an update on your funds and what you could do with them
		income differentiation (count money) -> you can't afford the food you wanted if you are poor
		
		
French have surrounded Paris - narration
	Last battle - what's at stake
	Ammunitions count according to your political inclinations and income
		Last option to Flee, fight, or hide
		Stay and fight
			You die but they still sing about you -> print out ode
		Flee 
			income outcome -> you get to bribe your way to the South, or you are executed
		hide
			pathetic ending -> you get insulted before the end of the game
			
exit game? play again option Y / N
